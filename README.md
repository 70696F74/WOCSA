'Worldwide Open Cyber Security Association' (WOCSA) - Personnal sandbox for development and practice.

This branch is dedicated to the CambrIoT Workshop

Activity summary : 

"
A burglar parks in front of a house and discovers a weakly protected Wi-Fi network. Using tools like Wifite or Evil Angel, he cracks the Wi-Fi password and connects to the network. He scans the network with Nmap and finds an outdated HomeAssistant server and a camera. Accessing the camera's control panel, he looks up the model online, finds the default password, and disables the camera. He also notices the HomeAssistant server and exploits a CVE vulnerability to gain access. Once inside, he deletes the Zigbee motion and door sensors. Finally, he brute-forces an NFC-connected lock using a flipper device and enters the house.
